No late submissions beyond what is outlined in the Slip Day policy will be accepted. We strongly encourage you to plan to submit your work to Gradescope several hours before the stated deadline. This way, you will have ample time to reach out to staff for support if you encounter difficulties with submission. While course staff is happy to help guide you with submitting your assignment ahead of the deadline, we will not respond to last-minute requests for assistance (TAs need to sleep, after all!).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",

If the $j$-th word in `words` is present at least once in the $i$-th email in `texts`, the output array should have a value of 1 at the position $(i, j)$. Otherwise, if the $j$-th word is not present in the $i$-th email, the value at $(i, j)$ should be 0.\n",

On the other hand, every Spam email (1 in Y_train) will be incorrectly classified as Ham (0), because the zero predictor always outputs 0. Thus, the number of False Negatives (FN) equals the total number of Spam emails in Y_train, which can be calculated using np.sum(Y_train).

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified emails (both True Positives and True Negatives) over all emails. Since TP = 0, the accuracy formula simplifies to TN  / Total Emails. Here, True Negatives (TN) are all the Ham emails in Y_train, which are correctly classified as Ham by the zero predictor. These are represented by the 0 values in Y_train. Thus, the accuracy is calculated as the total number of Ham emails (np.sum(Y_train == 0)) divided by the total number of emails (len(Y_train)). For Recall, the formula is TP / TP + FN. Since TP = 0, the numerator of the Recall formula is 0, resulting in a Recall value of 0."

A richer feature set, possibly including additional relevant words, would likely improve performance.\n",
