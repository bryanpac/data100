    "\n",
    "In Project A1, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models.\n",

This is especially problematic for low-income homeowners, for whom an overassessment could lead to an excessive financial burden without the corresponding increase in asset value.\n",

    "**C:** This system is particularly unfair because it creates a regressive tax system, where low-income homeowners, who typically own less expensive properties, end up paying a disproportionately higher share of taxes. This adds to the financial strain on those with less wealth while benefitting wealthier homeowners. Systematic bias that burdens lower-income groups is broadly seen as inequitable and undermines the fairness of the tax system.\n",

    "**D:** While this approach introduces a progressive element by shifting a greater tax burden to wealthier property owners, it may still be seen as unfair if the overvaluation is excessive. However, it could also be viewed as more fair in that it aligns with the principle of taxing those with higher wealth at a slightly higher rate, similar to progressive income tax systems.

    "The Chicago Tribune's investigation highlighted several central problems with Cook County's property tax system, which was shown to disproportionately impact lower-income and minority communities. Here are some key issues and primary causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regressive Tax Burden:** The system was regressive, meaning it placed a heavier tax burden on lower-prices homes, often overvaluing them while undervaluing higher-priced properties. This caused residents in poorer neighborhoods to pay a higher effective tax rate than those in wealthier areas, leading to stark inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Resistance to Reforms and Outdated Methods:** Under assessor Joseph Berrios, the office resisted implementing newer, more accurate assessment modes, instead relying on outdated systems and manual \"hand checks.\" Even when a state-of-the-art model funded by the MacArthur Foundation was developed to address these inaccuracies, Berrios delayed its use and continued to rely on flawed practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of Transparency and Accountability:** The assessor's office did not conduct regular ratio studies—a standard in property assessment to measure accuracy and fairness- and refused to share data about its valuation methods. This lack of transparency prevented the public and oversight bodies from holding the office accountable for systemic errors."

    "The Cook County property tax system placed a disproportionate tax burden on non-white property owners due to several compounding factors that intensified inequalities across racial socioeconomic lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overvaluation of Properties in Minority Communities:** Non-white and minority neighborhoods, which often had lower property values, were consistently over-assessed by the Cook County's Assessor's office. This meant that homes in these were valued at higher-than-market rates, leading to inflated property tax bills. Residents in predominately white, wealthier areas often benefitted from undervaluation, resulting in lower taxes relative to their actual property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduced Access to Appeals Process:** Although homeowners had the right to appeal their assessments, residents in minority and low-income neighborhoods were less likely to do so. Appealing an assessment requires financial resources, familiarity with the system, and access to legal representation- barriers that disproportionately affect non-white and lower-income property owners. In contrast, wealthy residents, who were more likely to appeal often succeeded in reducing their tax burden, further widening the gap in effective tax rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact of Political and Economic Factors:** The Chicago Tribune investigation highlighted the influence of powerful political allies and property tax attorneys linked to the assessor's office. These attorneys frequently represented high-value properties in wealthier, predominantly white areas, securing lower valuations and lower tax bills through appeals. The favoritism left minority communities shouldering a larger share of the tax burden,  as the system failed to protect lower-income and minority homeowners from equitable assessments."

Then, use these arrays to index into `data` to create your final `train` and `validation` `DataFrame`s. To ensure that your code matches the solution, use the first 80% as the training set and the last 20% as the validation set. Remember, the values you use to partition `data` must be integers!\n",

Instead of calling them manually one by one each time, it is best practice to encapsulate all of this feature engineering into one \"pipeline\" function. Defining and using a pipeline reduces all the feature engineering to just one function call and ensures that the same transformations are applied to all data.  Below, we combined some functions into a single helper function that outputs `X` and `Y` for the first model above. Try to understand what this function does! \n",

These functions are `remove_outliers`, `add_total_bedrooms`, `find_expensive_neighborhoods`, `add_in_expensive_neighborhood`, and `ohe_roof_material`. You are welcome to copy over your own implementations if you would like.\n",

    "**Note 2:** The staff implementation provided for `remove_outliers` is slightly different from what you did in Project A1. Here `remove_outliers` is exclusive for the bounds whereas in Project A1, it was inclusive for the bounds. `remove_outliers` will only output values strictly greater than the lower bound and strictly smaller than the upper bound. Feel free to still use your original implementation of the function; it shouldn't affect your score if it was done correctly but may slightly change your approach to `q5f`."

    "- **If you are running into memory issues, restart the kernel and only run the cells you need to.** The cell below (question cell) contains most to all of the imports necessary to successfully complete this portion of the project, so it can be completed independently code-wise from the remainder of the project, and you do not need to rerun the cell at the top of this notebook. The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",
    "- **If you need the data again after deleting the variables or resetting, you must reload them again from earlier in the notebook.**\n",
    "- You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",
    "- You MUST remove any additional new cells you add before submitting to Gradescope to avoid any autograder errors. \n",
    "- **You can only submit your test set prediction CSV file to Gradescope up to 4 times per day. Start early!** In the case that you are approved for an extension, you will be granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended.\n",

    "Just as in the guided model from the previous question, you should encapsulate as much of your workflow into functions as possible. Your job is to select better features and define your own feature engineering pipeline inside the function `feature_engine_final` in the following cell. Use of `.pipe` is not required, but you are welcome to incorporate it! **You must not change the parameters inside `feature_engine_final`. Do not edit the two lines at the end of the question cell below. They are helper functions that define a linear model, fit your data, and compute RMSE. If you do, you will receive no credit for this question.** \n",

    "- All other feature engineering techniques should be applied to both the training and test sets. This means that you should perform them under the condition `else:`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `True`, your function should return only the design matrix, `X`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `False`, your function should return both the design matrix and the response variable `Y` (the `Log Sale Price` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "-  Some features may have missing values in the test set but not in the training/validation set. Make sure `feature_engine_final` handles missing values appropriately for each feature.\n",
    "- We have imported all feature engineering functions from Project A1 for you. You do not have access to the `feature_func.py` file with the function body and definitions, but they work as defined in Project A1. Feel free to use them as you see fit!\n",
    "- You may wish to consider removing outlying datapoints from the training set before fitting your model. You may not, however, remove any datapoints from the test set (after all, the CCAO could not simply \"refuse\" to make predictions for a particular house!)\n",

    "**Scenario:** The model predictions seem to align more closely with **Scenario C.** The **overestimation plot** shows that lower log sale price intervals (representing less expensive properties) tend to have a larger percentage of overestimated values, while higher intervals (more expensive properties) see fewer overestimations. This pattern aligns with scenario C, where inexpensive properties are systematically overvalued, and expensive properties are undervalued. Such an outcome would lead to a regressive impact on taxation, disproportionately burdening lower-income homeowners with higher tax assessments relative to their property value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot:** The overestimation plot is the more useful of the two in determining whether the assessments lead to a progressive or regressive taxation. This is because it directly illistrates the proportion of properties in each interval that are overestimated, providing insight into how the model's prediction compare with actual values. A higher overestimation in lower intervals indicates regressive outcomes, as it implies that less-expensive properties are more frequently assessed, placing a greater tax burden on low-value property owners.

This residual impacts property taxes for individual homeowners by influencing their property's assessed value. Here's how the residual plays out in both positive and negative cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive Residual(Overestimation):** When the model overestimates the sale price (i.e., the predicted sale price is higher than the actual sale price), this leads to a positive residual. For the the homeowner, this overestimation can mean their property is valued at a higher rate than it would sell for, potentially resulting in **higher property taxes** than what is fair. This situation might disproportionately burden low-income homwowners if estimations are more or more extreme in certain communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Residual(Underestimation)** Conversely, when the model underestimates the sale price (i.e., the predicted sale price is lower than the actual sale price), this results in a negative residual. In this case, the homeowner's property can be assessed at a value lower than its market value, leading to **lower property taxes.** While this may benefit some homeowners, it can create disparities in tax contributions across different communities, especially if underestimations are more common for higher-income or more affluent neighborhoods."

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

This goes beyond simply achieving a low RMSE, which measures overall prediction error but does not account for biases that may affect different segments of the population unevenly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low RMSE alone doesn't guarantee fairness, as it may mask underlying disparaties. A model with a low RMSE might still be unfair if it achieves high accuracy for wealthier neighborhoods but lower accuracy for less affluent ones. Thus, fairness requires assessing the model's performance across subsets of the data and adjusting it to reduce systematic biases.\n",
